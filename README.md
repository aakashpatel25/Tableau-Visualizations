# Tableau-Visualizations
##List of data visualization that I created using Tableau

### FAA Wild Life Damage to Aircraft
Created few visualizations to answer questions such as
- In which state do most incidents occur?- What wildlife causes the most damage?- At what points during the flights do incidents occur?- During what month do the most incidents occur?- In NY state, what are the top 5 wildlife offenders?**What hypotheses can you make at this point?**- It is more likely to have an incident during approach of the flight than any other stage of the flight.
- Top 5 offenders in the state of New York are birds.
- While tailed deer is responsible for the most damage to the aircraft.
- Birds are generally responsible for damaging an aircraft.
- Most incidents are likely to occur during the fall term.


### FAA Wild Life Damage to Aircraft Using Geolocated Data
Created visualization that included map. Data consisted of latitude and longitude for each airport. Answered questions such as,
- Are some airports more prone to mishap than others?- How are they distributed?

**Does this tell you anything about why they get more incidents?**

I think number of factors affect the incident occurrence such as,
- Busyness of the airport
- Wildlife population, especially bird’s population in a given area.
