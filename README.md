### FAA Wild Life Damage to Aircraft
- Created few visualizations to answer questions such as
a. In which state do most incidents occur?b. What wildlife causes the most damage?c. At what points during the flights do incidents occur?d. During what month do the most incidents occur?e. In NY state, what are the top 5 wildlife offenders?*What hypotheses can you make at this point?*- It is more likely to have an incident during approach of the flight than any other stage of the flight.
- Top 5 offenders in the state of New York are birds.
- While tailed deer is responsible for the most damage to the aircraft.
- Birds are generally responsible for damaging an aircraft.
- Most incidents are likely to occur during the fall term.
